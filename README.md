# Template

This repo contains a template for writing a thesis in LaTeX.

## It includes the following files:

- header.tex – the title page of the thesis

- main.tex – the main document

- abstract.tex – the page for the thesis summary

- statement.tex – a document from the University of Koszalin (recreated by me because I only had a PDF file)

- packages.tex – a file that contains all package imports

There is also a directory called images for storing graphics, as well as a bibliography database bibliography.bib.

Additionally, this repo contains a template PDF showing what the thesis skeleton should look like after inserting your content.

# Online Editing

For online editing, I recommend `Overleaf` because you can easily share your document with your professor and you don’t need to install or configure any LaTeX packages manually.

# Local Editing

#### Windows
If you want to write LaTeX locally on Windows, I recommend miktex.
https://miktex.org/

However, there is an issue with Polish special characters due to the default shortcut for saving files being Alt + S. Because of that, using Visual Studio Code is usually a better option.

#### Linux
For Linux, I recommend using the vimtex plugin for a Neovim configuration.
